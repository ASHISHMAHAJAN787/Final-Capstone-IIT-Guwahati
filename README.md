# Dynamic Parking Pricing System

A real-time dynamic pricing engine for parking lots using occupancy, demand signals, and competitive analysis.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

### ï¿½ Pricing Models
- **Model 1**: Baseline Linear Model (Simple occupancy-based pricing)
- **Model 2**: Demand-Based Function (Occupancy + queue length + traffic + special events + vehicle type)
- **Model 3**: Competitive Pricing (Geographic proximity + competitor analysis)

### âš¡ Real-time Processing
- Powered by Pathway for stream processing
- Continuous data ingestion from `dataset.csv`
- Dynamic time-windowing and price updates

### ðŸ“Š Visualization Dashboard
- Real-time price trend graphs
- Occupancy rate heatmaps
- Interactive Bokeh plots with hover tooltips
- Demand indicators visualization

### ðŸ§  Smart Pricing Logic
- Base price of $10 with 0.5x-2x dynamic range
- Multi-factor consideration:
  - Occupancy rates
  - Queue lengths 
  - Traffic conditions
  - Special events
  - Vehicle type weights
- Competitive geographic analysis

## ðŸ“ˆ Mathematical Models

### Model 2: Demand Function
Demand = Î±Ã—(Occupancy/Capacity) + Î²Ã—QueueLength - Î³Ã—Traffic + Î´Ã—IsSpecialDay + ÎµÃ—VehicleTypeWeight
Price = BasePrice Ã— (1 + Î» Ã— NormalizedDemand)


### Model 3: Competitive Logic
- Haversine distance calculations
- Competitor price adjustments
- Smart rerouting suggestions

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
1. Place your dataset.csv in the project directory
2. Run in Google Colab (automatic dependency installation)
3. Access the real-time Panel dashboard
4. Monitor dynamic price adjustments
